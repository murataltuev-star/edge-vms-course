"""The resource job on a cluster is the platform's (vmsplatform.resource):
a `system` job on every server with meta.archive, serving buckets, taking
mirrors from its peers, retaining every subsystem's buckets by that
subsystem's policy. What this module adds is the VMS's part of it:

    ArchivePolicy   registered as the "vms" hook: repair the manifests, close buckets into them, retain media
    vms_routes      GET /manifest/<cam>  the manifest's lines;  GET /segment/<path>  the bytes, Range honoured

Nothing about mirrors, heartbeats or peers is the VMS's, and the names say
so: platform/resources/<server>/heartbeat, platform/mirror, job "resource".

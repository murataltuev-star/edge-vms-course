"""One camera's timeline across the resources it recorded into.

A camera that failed over has footage on two servers: the dead one's until
the failure, the new one's after. The console asks every resource that
reports the camera for its manifest and merges. A resource whose heartbeat
is stale is *unreachable*: its ranges are listed from the last thing known
about it — the manifest it served last time, if we cached it, or nothing —
and the answer says so by server. *Unavailable* is a state with a name in
it; *lost* is a word this module never prints for footage on a disk.

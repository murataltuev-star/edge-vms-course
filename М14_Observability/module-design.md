# М14_Observability — Module Design

**Seeing four layers you already built, from outside the one that failed.**

Every module before this one added a scope. This one adds none — it is how you see the four that exist. That makes it the only module in the course whose subject is the other modules, and it is why it comes last: the material is far easier to teach against a system the student has already broken on purpose four times.

It also **does not introduce observability.** М9–М12 already emit signals, each defined where the failure that needed it was introduced, because a metric chosen at the moment you watch something break has a reason and one chosen in an observability chapter has only a name. This module collects them, and adds what is genuinely cross-cutting.

> **Scope note.** Four lessons, 42–45. The position is still arguable: three of М13's lessons lean on instrumentation taught here — a thirty-day outage that can only be *asserted* without metrics, and a self-halting canary that **is** an alert rule. Emitting low softened that (М13 has numbers to work with), but did not remove it. See the sequencing section of [`COURSE-PLAN.md`](../COURSE-PLAN.md).

## The thesis

Datacentre monitoring assumes something this product cannot: that you can reach the thing you are monitoring.

> **In a datacentre, no news is bad news. At the edge, no news is *no news*.**

A target that stops responding in a rack is broken. A site that stops responding might be broken, or its uplink might be down, or the building might have lost power, or a customer's IT department might have changed a firewall rule on a Friday. **Those are four different problems for four different people, and the signal is identical in every case: nothing.**

Everything hard in this module comes out of that sentence. A monitoring system that cannot distinguish *broken* from *unreachable* will either page somebody every time a router reboots, or stay silent through a genuine outage — and in practice it does both, which is how a team learns to ignore it.

### The observer's paradox

The rule everybody knows:

> **Monitoring must not share a failure domain with the thing it monitors.**

A Prometheus running as a Nomad job inside the domain it watches dies with that domain and cannot tell you it died. Obvious, and at the edge it collides with a second fact: **Prometheus pulls**, and you cannot pull across the link you stopped trusting. To see anything at a site, the scraper has to be *at* the site — inside the failure domain the rule just forbade.

Both halves are true, so there is no single correct place, and the resolution is that **there are two observers with different jobs**:

| | **Local** — in the cluster | **Remote** — in the domain's hosting cluster |
|---|---|---|
| Sees | everything, at full resolution | whether the site is alive, and a handful of aggregates |
| Dies with | the site | nothing the site can cause |
| Answers | *what broke* | ***whether* anything broke** |
| Retention | days, on the data partition | long, cheap, small |

Neither alone is sufficient, and the failure of most edge monitoring is picking one. **The remote observer's only job is to distinguish silence from health** — everything else it could do, the local one does better and cheaper.

Which is a rule this course already has, arriving for the fourth time:

> **Detail is local; summary is domain.** [`where-the-database-lives.md`](../М12_DomainVMS/where-the-database-lives.md) named it for footage, the archive index and events, and said "the fourth one will arrive eventually." **Metrics are the fourth.**

## The demo it is built backwards from

A wall showing four sites. Then, in order:

1. **A camera stops recording** while every control-plane field says it is healthy — and the console goes amber on `camera_silent_seconds` alone.
2. **A server dies.** Its Node moves. **One** alert fires, naming the server, not two hundred naming cameras.
3. **A cluster's uplink is cut.** The domain shows it as **unreachable, not healthy and not broken**, with the age of its last report and what is therefore unknown.
4. **The uplink returns.** The backlog drains at a stated rate, the gap in the graphs is visible and labelled, and nothing was invented to fill it.
5. Finally, a student greps the whole monitoring stack for a camera password **and finds nothing**, because Lesson 45 made that impossible.

If a lesson does not move that wall forward, it does not belong here.

## Decisions taken

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Collection | **Prometheus, pull, plus agent mode at constrained sites** | Apache 2.0, the ecosystem's default, and its agent mode is built for exactly this shape. |
| Topology | **Two observers: local full-resolution, remote aliveness plus aggregates** | The observer's paradox above. Neither position alone is correct. |
| What travels | **Aggregates and alarms, never raw series** | The thin uplink is already carrying the product's own publications; monitoring must not compete with footage. |
| Cardinality | **No per-object series.** Distributions, plus the database for detail | A thousand cameras is a thousand series per metric. A metric is not a database. |
| Alerting | **On the product, not the process** | М9 Lesson 18's rule, stated once for everything above it. |
| Silence | **A first-class state, never rendered as health** | The module's thesis. `unreachable` is not `up` and not `down`. |
| Logs | **Local, structured, and never containing a secret** | М10 Lesson 20 found the password inside `rtsp_url`; the leak is a formatting bug, not a storage one. |
| Dashboards | **Ship none. See the licensing section** | Grafana is **AGPLv3**, and §6 triggers on shipping at all — modified or not. This is a sharper constraint than the BUSL one the course already settled. |

## Prerequisites

- **М9 Lesson 18** — the health-check ladder, and *a health check is not monitoring*. This module supplies the other half of that distinction.
- **М9 Lesson 19** — `spool_oldest_seconds`, and why age beats count.
- **М10 Lesson 20** — events are not metrics; and the credential hiding in `rtsp_url`, which Lesson 49 collects on.
- **М10 Lesson 24** — `camera_lag` and `camera_silent_seconds`, and positions versus reasons.
- **М11 Lesson 28** and **М12 Lesson 30** — failover duration, epoch conflicts, replica lag.
- **М12 Lesson 37** — regions, because a fleet view spans them.

---

## What is already emitted

The module opens by taking inventory rather than by installing anything:

| From | Signal | Established there because |
|---|---|---|
| М9 L18 | the health-check ladder | it decides **rollback**, on the box, offline |
| М9 L19 | `spool_oldest_seconds`, `spool_bytes_used` | the spool was the first thing whose health was a *quantity* |
| М10 L24 | `camera_lag` (distribution), `camera_silent_seconds` | the second is the only one describing the product |
| М11 L28 | `node_failover_seconds`, `node_epoch_conflicts` | RTO, and a counter that should be zero forever |
| М12 L30 | `node_replica_lag_seconds` | the RPO made visible per Node |

**Six signals for a whole VMS.** That is the point, and it is worth saying to a student who expects a hundred: each one was chosen at the moment its failure was demonstrated, and nothing was added because it was easy to measure.

---

## The licensing problem, which is worse than Nomad's

The course has one settled licensing thread — Nomad under BUSL, resolved because the Additional Use Grant permits a non-competitive product to embed it. **The monitoring stack is a harder case and it needs stating before a student builds an appliance around a dashboard.**

| Component | Licence | Shippable in an appliance? |
|---|---|---|
| **Prometheus**, incl. agent mode | Apache 2.0 | Clean |
| **VictoriaMetrics**, single *and* cluster | Apache 2.0 | Clean |
| **Thanos**, **Cortex** | Apache 2.0 | Clean |
| **OpenTelemetry Collector** (core + contrib) | Apache 2.0 | Clean |
| **Grafana Alloy** | Apache 2.0 | Clean |
| **Grafana** | **AGPLv3** | **See below** |
| **Loki**, **Tempo**, **Mimir** | **AGPLv3** | Same |

Grafana, Loki and Tempo relicensed from Apache 2.0 to AGPLv3 in **April 2021**; Mimir has been AGPLv3 from the start. Agents were deliberately left Apache — which is why Alloy is clean and Grafana is not.

**Why this is sharper than BUSL.** BUSL's grant *permits* production use and forbids only a competing offering, so a VMS was simply outside its restriction. AGPL has no such carve-out:

- **§6 triggers on conveying at all** — modified or not. Putting an AGPL binary on hardware a customer buys **is** conveying, and you owe them the Corresponding Source: *"all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work."* Note **install** and **modify**.
- **§13 triggers on modification** — and every user reaching your UI over the network must be offered the source of *your modified version*. Theming it, rebranding it, wiring it to your auth: all modification.
- **Grafana's free Enterprise binary does not solve it.** It is proprietary and its licence agreement forbids you to *"distribute, sublicense… or make available"* the object code to third parties. Redistribution needs an OEM agreement.

**And the question that actually decides it is one a VMS walks straight into**: a video product wants dashboards *inside* its own console, not on a separate port. The tighter that coupling, the more arguable it becomes that the proprietary VMS is a covered work. Loose coupling — separate process, network API, no linking, no embedding — is the standard mitigation, and it is a design constraint rather than a legal footnote.

> **The course's position: teach Prometheus, and ship no dashboard.** Build the console you already have — М10 Lesson 24 built one and М12 Lesson 32 extended it — and let Grafana be something the *customer* installs and points at your Apache-2.0 endpoint. That keeps every shipped component permissive, and it is a better product decision anyway: an operator should not need two consoles.

Not legal advice, and the anti-tivoisation clause in §6 deserves its own look for a secure-boot appliance. But a course that teaches students to embed Grafana in a product they sell, without saying this, has done them harm.

## Lessons

*Four lessons. The system already emits; this is how you see it from outside.*

### Lesson 42 — What you already emit, and what silence means

- **Take inventory first.** The six signals above, and for each one: what it cannot tell you. That column is the lesson
- Build the exporter: a `/metrics` endpoint on the Node, exposing what М10 Lesson 24 already computes. **No new measurements** — this is plumbing over decisions already taken
- Metric types, and picking them correctly: `camera_silent_seconds` is a **gauge**, `node_epoch_conflicts` is a **counter**, and confusing them makes the second unalertable
- **The three states of a target, kept apart:** `up`, `down`, and **`unknown`**. Prometheus gives you `up` for free and *nothing* for the third — the site whose scrape failed is indistinguishable from the site that is fine but unreachable. Deriving the third is this module's whole thesis in one expression
- **Staleness, and the honest gap.** When a Node returns after an outage, its metrics have a hole. Do not interpolate it, do not carry the last value forward — **render the gap**, because a flat line through an outage is a lie an operator will act on

**Deliverable:** one scrape endpoint per Node, and a written table of every signal with what it cannot tell you.

---

### Lesson 43 — Where the observer runs

- The observer's paradox from above, and the two-observer resolution
- **Prometheus agent mode** — introduced in 2.32 behind a feature flag, now the `--agent` CLI flag. It disables the local TSDB, alerting and rule evaluation and optimises for scraping plus remote write. Built for small resource-constrained deployments, which is what a site is
- **But at a site you usually want the opposite:** a *full* local Prometheus with real retention, because the moment you most need history is the moment the uplink is down. Agent mode fits the small site with no local operator; a recording site wants local storage. **Make students pick per site and justify it**
- **What crosses the uplink**, and the arithmetic beside М13's: metrics measured in kilobits per second against footage measured in megabits. Monitoring must not compete with the product for the link
- **Remote write**: v1.0 is the stable spec (April 2023) and mandates **Snappy** compression; v2.0 is still marked experimental. Say which you are using and why
- **Federation** is for pulling *selected*, typically *aggregated*, series between servers. The widespread advice not to federate everything is community practice rather than a documented warning — **teach the reasoning, and attribute it honestly**
- Where the *remote* observer lives: **the domain's hosting cluster**, as one more domain service — a different failure domain from every other cluster, and the same one as the signer. It is allowed to be down, so it may not be the thing that decides anything; and it watches the hosting cluster itself only from *inside*, which is the one blind spot the design accepts and names

**Deliverable:** kill an entire cluster and show that the domain still reports it as unreachable within a stated window — and that nothing in that cluster stopped recording.

---

### Lesson 44 — Alarms somebody will act on

- **Alarm on the product, not the process.** М9 Lesson 18's ladder, generalised: every alert names a thing the customer paid for
- **Symptom, not cause.** One alert per failure, at the level a human acts on. М12's failure-domain grouping already does the work — a dead server is **one** alert, not two hundred
- **Every alert needs an action.** An alert with no runbook is a notification, and notifications train people to filter
- **The silence problem, properly.** Three cases, three different responses: the site is broken, the *link* is broken, the *monitoring* is broken. Deriving which needs a signal that does not travel over the failed path — a heartbeat, a second route, or an honest *"unknown since 14:02"*
- **Thresholds come from earlier arithmetic, not taste.** The spool alarm from М9's partition sizing, the replica-lag alarm from М12's stated RPO. Every number in this lesson was decided in an earlier module
- **Alert fatigue as a design failure**, measured: alerts per week per operator, and what fraction were acted on

**Deliverable:** an alert set in which every alert has a written action, plus a test that a silent site produces **exactly one** alert — and that the alert says *unknown*, not *down*.

---

### Lesson 45 — Logs, secrets, and one failure through four layers

The capstone, and it is a reading exercise as much as a building one.

- journald: retention on a data partition sized for footage, rate limiting, and why an unbounded log is a disk-full incident waiting for a busy night
- **Structured logs**, so a machine can filter what a human cannot read
- **Never log a secret — and М10 Lesson 20 showed why this is a formatting bug, not a storage one.** An RTSP URL carries `user:pass@` inline, so *any* code path that logs a URL leaks a credential: the pipeline description, the bus error, the exception, the support bundle. Grep for it, find the paths, and fix the composition rather than the log line
- **What travels upward:** alarms and counts, never log bodies. A site's logs stay at the site and are fetched on demand — the same shape as footage, index, events and metrics
- **The capstone:** induce one failure at each layer — a bad OS update (М9), a stalled camera (М10), a dead server (М11), an unreachable directory (М12) — and for each, state **which signal fired first, which fired second, and what the operator saw.** Then do it again with the uplink down

**Deliverable:** a support bundle a field engineer could actually use, containing no credentials — and the four-failure table, written.

---

## Verification plan

**Track 1 — verified in the authoring sandbox.** Most of it. Prometheus is a single binary with no dependencies; exporters, recording rules, alert rules and their unit tests (`promtool test rules`) are all files. Cardinality can be demonstrated by generating series and watching memory. The credential-grep exercise is `grep`.

**Track 2 — needs the bench.** Anything with a real uplink to cut: the two-observer topology, remote write under loss, and the backlog drain. And the capstone needs М9–М12 actually running.

**A note on honesty here:** this module can *assert* alert quality more easily than it can demonstrate it, and that is a trap. The deliverables are written tables and runbooks for exactly that reason — an alert set is judged by what a human does at 3am, which no test asserts.

---

## Open questions

1. **Does this module belong before М13?** Three of М13's lessons lean on instrumentation taught here. Emitting low softened it; the argument is not dead.
2. **One Prometheus per domain, or per site?** They are the same thing when a domain is one building and different when a domain is a cloud region serving fifty small sites — which М13's mixed deployment makes routine.
3. **Who watches the hosting cluster?** The remote observer lives there, so it cannot see its own cluster from outside. The vendor could host a second-level heartbeat as a support service — but the product must not *depend* on it, so the honest answer may be that the hosting cluster's death is discovered by a human noticing the console is gone.
4. **Is a customer-installed Grafana an acceptable answer**, or does the product need a dashboard it ships? The licensing section takes a position; a product manager may not accept it.
5. **What is the retention for metrics at a site?** Sized against the same partition as the spool and the archive, and therefore competing with footage for disk. Nobody has costed this.

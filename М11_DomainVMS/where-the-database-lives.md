# Where the Databases Live

**A decision record for М10_NodeVMS and М11_DomainVMS.** Companion to [`apphost-and-process-model.md`](../М9_EdgeVMS/apphost-and-process-model.md) and [`consul-and-openbao.md`](../М12_FederatedVMS/consul-and-openbao.md), written in answer to *"a domain exists when its Postgres exists — so is Postgres installed on every host, and how do they sync?"*, and then revised in answer to a second question that corrected it: *if the host needs an event store and an index anyway, why not Postgres locally too?*

It was revised a third time, and that revision **inverted the second verdict below.** The question that did it: *the Node is a Nomad allocation, not a server — its configuration does not change when Nomad moves it from one server to another, so why does anything need to write ownership at all?* That is right, and the design changed because of it.

A fourth revision followed the PKI split — М11 now runs a certificate authority in every domain, which poses a *where does the key live* question this record is the right place to answer — and while making it, **found this record wrong in five places about the epoch.** It said the domain database issues it. It does not: the epoch is a Nomad Variable, and everything downstream of that error is corrected below.

A fifth revision removed the domain database entirely. The objection that did it was aimed at this record's own first verdict — *"a node database, one per Node, and a domain directory, one per domain; both Postgres"* — and consisted of pointing at the last three words. It is wrong, and the reason it took five revisions to see is instructive: the directory does two jobs with nothing in common, and a database is the obvious answer to either one taken alone.

Each revision is left visible rather than quietly edited out, because the sequence is the lesson.

---

## Verdict

Five things. The first was wrong in every earlier draft, in a different way each time.

1. **One database, and it belongs to a Node.** Postgres per Node, holding its configuration, its archive index and its events. **The domain has no database at all** — its directory is a Nomad Variable per Node plus an object per Node in an object store, because those two halves are a small consistent thing and a large opaque thing and neither is a query workload.
2. **The Node owns its configuration and replicates one way upward.** It does not cache someone else's. A Node is a Nomad allocation with stable identity, so when a server dies the Node moves and **its cameras go with it** — nothing rewrites ownership, because ownership never changed.
3. **Destructive operations must never run from state whose authority is unreachable.** Recording continues; deletion does not.
4. **A domain is the largest set of nodes sharing a reliable network.** That is what decides where domain boundaries fall, and it makes the whole Edge → Node → Domain → Federation progression physical rather than arbitrary.
5. **Storage is chosen by shape, not by habit.** Small and consistent goes in the scheduler's store; large and queryable goes in the database; large and opaque goes in an object store. A record about where databases live turns out to be mostly about what they are *not* for.

---

## A domain is not its database

The original question assumed it was, and two drafts of this record agreed. The answer is narrower: **a domain is a set of Nodes on a reliable network.** Configuration lives in the Nodes; the domain holds a directory of them.

Putting Postgres on every Node and synchronising *bidirectionally* would still be wrong, and the reasons are worth keeping because they are what constrains the design:

- **Multi-master** — for a desired-state store, conflicting writes are precisely what must not happen. "Camera 7 belongs to Node A" and "camera 7 belongs to Node B", merged, is the split-brain Lesson 29 exists to prevent
- **A consensus system** — which is what you would end up building, and Postgres is not one

What makes the design work is that **neither is needed, because every row has exactly one writer by construction.** A Node writes its own configuration and nothing else writes it. The synchronisation is one-way and therefore not synchronisation at all — it is publication.

---

## The Node owns; the domain observes

Two earlier drafts of this record had it the other way round — a domain database as the authority, hosts holding read-only caches of their slice. That works, and it is what most control planes do. It is also **strictly less available than it needs to be**, and the reason is worth stating precisely.

**A Node is a Nomad allocation, not a server.** Its identity is stable; Nomad decides which hardware runs it. So camera 7 belongs to Node 3 *permanently*, and a dead server is not an ownership change — it is a relocation. Nothing has to write "Node 3 now lives on Server B" into a configuration store, because no camera moved.

Once that is true, the case for a central configuration authority mostly evaporates:

| | Domain-authoritative (earlier drafts) | **Node-authoritative** (this design) |
|---|---|---|
| Who writes camera 7's config | the controller | **Node 3, the only writer** |
| Editing while the domain is unreachable | impossible | **works — reach the Node** |
| Ownership on failover | rewritten by the controller | **never rewritten** |
| What the domain holds | everything | a directory and a durable copy |

Both designs have exactly one writer per row, so neither has a merge problem. The difference is *where that writer sits*, and putting it at the Node keeps configuration next to the software that uses it.

### What a Node actually holds

- **Its configuration** — its cameras, their settings, its retention policy. **Owned, not cached.** Replicated one way upward for durability and lookup
- **The archive index** — which segment covers which camera over which range. Written constantly; rebuildable by scanning
- **Events** — motion, camera offline, analytics hits, operator actions. High volume, mostly never read
- **Its own certificate and key** — how it proves it is Node 3 on every stream to the directory. Short-lived, renewed from the domain's CA, and the key never leaves the Node

> This does not contradict М10's rule that *desired state is persisted and actual state is derived*. The Node persists desired state because it *is* the authority for it; what stays derived is everything about what is actually running.

### The domain has no database

Earlier drafts of this record put a Postgres in every domain and then spent a page arguing about how to make it highly available. Both the database and the argument were avoidable, and seeing why requires noticing that **the directory is two jobs wearing one name.**

| | **The list** | **The restore point** |
|---|---|---|
| Holds | which Nodes exist, which cameras belong to which, how far behind each is | a durable copy of each Node's configuration |
| Size | kilobytes | megabytes, growing with the fleet |
| Written | on create, rebalance, and each status report | on every publication |
| **Read** | **constantly** — every console page | **once, during a failover that may never happen** |
| Queried? | yes — *where is camera 7* | **never.** Nothing but the Node that wrote it ever parses it |
| Needs | consistency | durability |

A database is a defensible answer to either column alone. It is a poor answer to both at once, and the instinct to have one store rather than two is what produced the Postgres. So:

- **The list is a Nomad Variable per Node.** Already replicated across the Nomad servers, already how a Node learns its identity and its epoch, already ACL'd. Hundreds of bytes per Node: camera ids, and the revision its configuration object is at
- **The restore point is an object per Node.** Write-rarely, read-almost-never, opaque — the definition of an object store's workload, and М9's appliance already speaks to one

**What this buys, beyond one fewer component:**

- **One writer per key becomes a platform property rather than a convention.** A Nomad ACL policy can say Node 3 writes only `nodes/node-3`. In Postgres that guarantee was discipline; here it is enforced
- **The HA argument disappears.** Nomad's raft is replicated because the scheduler needs it to be; object storage durability is what an object store sells. Neither is something a customer has to operate
- **A domain becomes a set of Nodes on a network, literally** — nothing to install, so no box whose loss is the domain's loss

**The cost, stated plainly:** two mechanisms instead of one, an object store that must exist on-premises for air-gapped sites (MinIO, and someone must back *that* up), and a lookup that scans rather than queries — fine at tens of Nodes per domain, and a stated limit somewhere in the low hundreds.

### The Node's own database

Still Postgres, and still one. An earlier draft said SQLite was plenty; that was answering a narrower question than a Node actually poses, because **the index and the events need a real database regardless** — so a Node is running Postgres either way, and putting configuration anywhere else buys nothing.

| | Node database |
|---|---|
| Instances | **one per Node** |
| Written by | **this Node only** |
| Holds | **its own configuration**, archive **index**, events |
| Size | large and always growing |
| Write rate | ~100 rows/sec at a thousand cameras, plus events |
| Backup | index and events reconstructible by rescanning segments; **configuration is not**, which is what the restore point is for |
| Losing it costs | **that Node's configuration**, unless its published object survives |

**Why Postgres locally rather than SQLite**, once index and events are in the picture:

- **Concurrency.** SQLite permits one writer at a time; WAL lets readers run alongside a writer but does not change that. Twenty media workers writing index rows, an event stream, and the AppHost reading is real contention
- **Partitioning is the decisive feature.** Index and events are both rolling time windows. `DROP PARTITION` against `DELETE FROM` on a table taking a hundred rows a second is not a close comparison, and it makes М10 Lesson 23's retention loop instant instead of a vacuum problem
- **Types that match the work.** `tstzrange` with a GiST index answers *what footage covers this window* directly — which is М8's timeline query — and JSONB carries event payloads that differ per detector
- **One engine, one skillset.** The same `psql`, `pg_dump`, monitoring and client library. Students learn one thing; whoever operates the appliance operates one thing

### What stays outside the databases, and why

**Only one database is left in the design**, so this list is longer than the thing it is an exception to. That is the point: naming the reasons matters more than the list, because the reasons are what tell you where the next one goes.

| | Where it lives | Out of the database because |
|---|---|---|
| **Last-known assignment** | a few hundred bytes on the Node's disk | Postgres is now in the boot path for recording. `After=postgresql.service` costs seconds and is fine; a data directory corrupted by power loss is not, and a Node that cannot record at all is a worse outcome than one recording from a stale hint |
| **The epoch** | a Nomad Variable, check-and-set | It is a **fencing token**, so it must never go backwards — and a database restored from last night's backup hands out numbers it has already issued. Nomad's raft store gives monotonicity and survives losing a server |
| **The directory list** | a Nomad Variable per Node | Small, consistent, and needed by the thing that does the rescheduling. Putting it in a database meant installing one per domain to hold a few kilobytes |
| **The restore point** | an object per Node | Large and **opaque** — no query ever touches it, and durability rather than consistency is the requirement. See above |
| **The domain CA's private key** | offline, or a token, never a table | A key in a database is a key in every backup, every replica, and every `pg_dump` a support engineer ever takes. Issuance is an online service; the key it signs with does not have to be, and the only thing that must be online is the intermediate's *signing capability*, not its storage |

A crash-recovery hint, a correctness primitive, a small consistent index, a large opaque blob, and a signing key. The last is the one most likely to be got wrong by convenience, because a certificates table is genuinely useful — **issued certificates are directory entries; the key that signed them is not.**

---

## The rule this makes general

The course had already made this decision twice without naming it as one principle:

| Layer                  | May be unavailable to | What the layer below does                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Controller (М11)       | Workers               | keep recording from cached assignments            |
| Domain (М11)           | Nodes                 | keep editing their own configuration, and renew their own certificates |
| Federation (М12)       | Domains               | keep operating on cached identity and entitlement, and **issue certificates from an intermediate delegated to them** |

> **Every layer is allowed to be unavailable to the layer beneath it, and the layer beneath caches what it needs to carry on.**

Stated once, it becomes a design rule rather than three separate accidents — and it is the thing that makes an edge product different from a datacentre one.

### Caching is not the only way down

The PKI split exposed a second mechanism the rule had been hiding, and it is the better one where it is available.

- **Caching** hands down a *value*. It goes stale, and everything above about grace periods and destructive operations exists to manage that staleness.
- **Delegation** hands down an *authority*. A domain given an intermediate CA does not hold a cached certificate that expires — it **mints fresh ones indefinitely** with the centre gone, which is why routine issuance never leaves the site.

Delegation is strictly stronger, and it is available exactly when the thing handed down can be bounded and withdrawn on a schedule — which is what a certificate lifetime *is*. That also says precisely what cannot be delegated: **a secret has no such operation.** You cannot hand a domain a bounded, expiring piece of a password; you can only give it a copy, which is another place to steal it from. So the CA moves down into the domain and the vault does not, and that asymmetry — not a preference about topology — is why М12's appliance holds certificates and runs no vault.

---

## Stale caches, and the operation that must never run from one

Here is the finding that matters most, because getting it wrong destroys customer data silently.

A cached desired state has an age. What is safe to do with an old one **depends on the operation**:

| From a three-week-old cache | Safe? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Keep recording what you were already recording | **Yes**, indefinitely | Recording is the safe default. A camera still running is never the wrong answer |
| Start recording something new | Questionable | The instruction may have been withdrawn; nothing is lost by waiting |
| **Delete footage under the cached retention policy** | **No** | Irreversible, and the policy may have changed |

**Node-owned configuration removes the worst version of this failure**, and it is worth seeing why. Under a domain-authoritative design an operator raises retention from 7 days to 30 on Monday, the Node loses contact on Tuesday, and on Wednesday it deletes everything older than a week — obeying a policy that was superseded, *silently*, because the edit succeeded at the domain and simply never arrived. Under Node-owned configuration that edit **fails loudly**: the operator cannot reach the Node, so nothing was promised.

The rule survives, relocated to the two places staleness can still occur:

- **Anything a Node caches from above** — entitlement, licence state, placement decisions
- **A Node restored from the domain's copy after failover**, where that copy may be several revisions behind the Node that died

> **Destructive operations stop at the grace period. Recording does not.**

A Node that cannot confirm its retention policy keeps footage and reports that it is doing so. Disks fill; that is a visible, recoverable problem. Deleted footage is neither.

---

## Where the domain boundary falls

Node-owned configuration means a Node no longer depends on the network for its *own* settings. But four things still cross it — creating a camera, rebalancing, **reaching the epoch issuer**, and **restoring a dead Node's configuration from the directory** — and the last two are what a failover needs. A domain spanning a link you do not trust is a domain that cannot fail over.

> **A domain is the largest set of nodes that share a reliable network.**

Three buildings on one campus LAN: one domain. Fifty stores across a country: fifty domains, federated. The boundary is not organisational and not a matter of taste — **each level of the progression begins at a network you stopped trusting**, which is what makes Edge → Node → Domain → Federation physical rather than a tidy-looking hierarchy.

This settles two of М11's open questions at once: one controller per domain, and a domain per reliable network.

---

## The high-availability argument this design does not have

Earlier drafts of this record spent a page here choosing between repmgr, pg_auto_failover and Patroni for the domain database. **There is no domain database, so there is no choice to make** — but the page is kept, marked as superseded, because the reasoning is the reason the database went away.

**What losing the directory costs now:** creating cameras, cross-Node lookup, rebalancing, certificate issuance for new services, and — the one that matters — every Node's off-box restore point, so no failover can complete. Recording continues. So does editing a camera at its own Node, and renewing a certificate a Node already holds, up to its lifetime.

> **The directory is not needed to run; it is needed to recover.**

That was already a weaker requirement than a database's — a backup may be minutes stale and briefly unreachable without anyone noticing. Splitting it removed the requirement entirely: **Nomad's raft is replicated because the scheduler needs it to be, and durability is what an object store sells.** Both are highly available for reasons that have nothing to do with this product, which is the cheapest kind of availability there is.

### Superseded, and kept for the trap in it

| Option | What it needs | Verdict *(when the directory was Postgres)* |
|---|---|---|
| **Single Postgres, backup and restore** | Nothing | The default. Honest for an appliance |
| **repmgr** | A witness node holding no data, as referee before a standby promotes | Reasonable when a customer asks for HA |
| **pg_auto_failover** | A monitor node that actively coordinates state changes | Same class, arguably simpler to reason about |
| **Patroni** | A distributed configuration store — etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper or Kubernetes | **The trap** |
| Domain database in the federated layer | A working uplink | Never. Inverts М12's thesis |

**The Patroni trap is why this section survives its own obsolescence**, because it is exactly the kind of dependency that arrives sideways. Patroni requires a DCS, and the obvious candidates are etcd or Consul. [`consul-and-openbao.md`](../М12_FederatedVMS/consul-and-openbao.md) had just argued Consul out of the stack — so choosing Patroni meant either bringing it back or adding etcd instead, and the database's availability would then depend on a consensus cluster the product otherwise has no use for.

Which is the general lesson, and it applies to more than Patroni: **when making a component highly available requires a second component that is already highly available, ask whether the state could simply live in the second one.** For the epoch, and then for the whole directory, the answer was yes — the Nomad servers were already a replicated consensus cluster, sitting there, doing scheduling. The database was the thing that did not need to exist.

**What is genuinely worth protecting is the CA key**, and it never was a Postgres problem. Losing the directory costs a restore point that every living Node republishes within one publication interval. Losing the domain's signing key means reissuing every certificate in the domain, and losing it *to someone else* means a domain whose entire mutual authentication is forged. Different failure, different mechanism, and none of the table above speaks to it.

---

## Detail is local, summary is domain

This answers М11's third open question, and then turns out to answer more than that.

Suppose the archive index lived at the domain rather than at the Node. During any domain outage recording would continue but **the footage would become unfindable** — the worst kind of failure, because it is silent and to a customer it is indistinguishable from data loss. That alone rules it out, before any argument about write rates.

So split it by who wrote it:

- **The Node that recorded the footage owns its index**, locally. Writing it never needs the network
- **The domain holds a rollup only** — *"Node 3 has camera 7"*, in that Node's Variable beside its camera ids. Coarse enough to stay inside a key-value entry, which is the test for whether something belongs at the domain at all
- **Playback asks the domain *where*, then the Node *what***

Which extends the rule М10 Lesson 26 already teaches — *do not put video bulk on replicated storage; replicate metadata and let footage be local* — one level up: **replicate the summary, not the index.**

### The same shape, three times

| Data | Local | Forwarded to the domain |
|---|---|---|
| Footage | every segment | nothing |
| Archive index | every segment's time range, and which server's disks hold it | which Node has which camera — a list, not a timeline |
| Events | every event | alarms needing acknowledgement, and counts |

> **Detail is local; summary is domain.** Three data types, one rule — worth naming once rather than rediscovering per data type, because the fourth one will arrive eventually.

### Events, which the design was missing

Events — motion, camera offline, analytics hits, operator actions — were not in the plan at all and belong here. They also need distinguishing sharply from М13's material, because they look alike:

> **Events are product data: an operator searches them. Metrics are operational data: an engineer alarms on them.** Different consumers, different retention, different modules.

Most events are never read. A filtered subset — alarms an operator must acknowledge — forwards to the domain so the console can show them without querying every Node. The rest ages out of a partitioned table locally.

---

## What this means

| Criterion | Answer |
|---|---|
| Postgres per Node? | **Yes — that is where configuration lives.** And it is the only Postgres in the design |
| Postgres per domain? | **No.** The directory is a Nomad Variable per Node plus an object per Node. Nothing to install, nothing to make highly available |
| Why not SQLite? | Index and events need a real database anyway, so a second engine is pure cost |
| How do Nodes sync? | One way, upward. Each Node is the only writer of its own rows |
| What survives a domain outage? | Recording, playback, **and configuration edits made at the Node** |
| What stops? | Creating a camera, rebalancing, cross-Node lookup, issuing certificates to new services, and **restoring a dead Node — so failover cannot complete** |
| Where does the directory live? | **The list in Nomad Variables, the restore point in an object store.** Chosen by shape: small and consistent, then large and opaque |
| Where does the epoch come from? | **A Nomad Variable.** A fencing token must never go backwards, and a restored database hands out numbers it already issued |
| Where does the CA key live? | **Not in any of the three stores.** Issued certificates are directory entries; the key that signed them is offline or in a token |
| What happens when a server dies? | Nomad moves the Node; its cameras go with it; **ownership is never rewritten** |
| Where does the domain end? | At the first network you would not bet recording on |
| HA? | **Not a question the design asks any more.** Nomad's raft is replicated for scheduling; object storage durability is its product. Nothing was made highly available *for this* |

**Course changes.** М10 Lesson 20 builds **one** database, owned by the Node, and what М10 builds *is a Node* — so М11 adds Nodes rather than restructuring anything. М11 Part A now carries what makes failover real: what must outlive a server, shared storage versus one-way replication, and fencing. Part B shrinks to the three things a Node cannot know about itself.

**Product recommendation: the Node is the authority for its own configuration and owns the only database; the domain is a Variable, an object, and a certificate authority.** Nothing in that list has to be available for the product to *record*; the directory has to be available for the product to *recover*. Five revisions of this record moved in one direction throughout — **every one of them took state out of a database** — and the last one removed the database.

# М10_ServerVMS — Module Design

**The platform's shape on one server: a controller, a worker, and the archive as a resource — prototyped without a scheduler, without KVS, and without a database.**

[М9](../М9_EdgeVMS/README.md) ends with a box that owns its OS and its truth: an A/B root under RAUC, and a Node whose Postgres holds what it should be while an AppHost makes it so. [М11](../М11_ClusterVMS/module-design.md) then took that Node, put it under a scheduler, and — in the decision it reached last — took it apart: **workers, resources, one controller** (*2c*). This module is where that shape is built for the first time, on one box, so that every piece can be seen running before М11 spreads it across servers.

> **What changed since М9's Node design** ([`node-design.md`](../М9_EdgeVMS/node-design.md), now Lessons 5–9 of М9). That design gave the Node its own Postgres, an AppHost supervising fifty pipelines, and a spool publishing to KVS. Three things are retired here and one is kept. **KVS is gone**: the archive is ours, on the spool's discipline. **The per-box Postgres is gone**: configuration lives in the platform's stores and has one writer. **The AppHost is gone**: the thing that holds the pipeline is the worker, and it supervises itself. What is kept, unchanged and enforced by the same tests, is the contract: desired persisted and actual derived, `>=` on the revision, backoff with jitter, positions apart from reasons, the epoch in the path, commit-then-publish, the heartbeat carrying its status.

> **Four words, kept apart — and one retired.** Server, Cluster, Domain, Site mean what the course has always meant. *Node* is retired *(12 September 2026)*: М9 needed a word for a recorder that was a process with its own database and disk, distinct from the box; under this shape what is on a physical server is the platform's stores, a **resource**, and the **workers** placed there, and their sum is just the **server**. М9 Lessons 5–9 keep the word as history.

## The thesis

The platform is everything that does not know what a camera is: a scheduler that places processes by constraint (М11), a small consistent config store, an object store, a signer and an agent for trust (М12), a web gateway, an observer (М13). A **subsystem** is what a product team gives the platform, and it is always the same two things:

| | What it is | How many | State | When it is down |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Controller** | the only writer of the subsystem's configuration and of the assignment of work to workers | one per cluster — and safe at two, because every write is check-and-set | none of its own: computation over the platform's stores | no edits, no new assignments; nothing already running stops |
| **Worker** | runs the subsystem's work — for the VMS, pipelines — against its assignment; reports by heartbeat | 1+ per cluster, by workload; the scheduler runs as many as needed | none but a spool; a fresh worker rediscovers everything from its assignment | its share of the work stops until the scheduler restarts it; the epoch and the lease make the restart harmless |

The VMS is the first subsystem: **`vmscontroller`** and **`vmsworker`**. Detectors are the second (`detectorcontroller`, `detectorworker`); the live gateway is the third. The platform knows the shape — a config prefix, an assignment per worker, a heartbeat object per worker, a metrics endpoint — and nothing about video. That is what "isolating the VMS logic from the platform" means as an artifact rather than an intention: the platform package in this module has no import of anything under `vms/`, and the tests prove it by running a second, trivial subsystem through the same code.

**Resources** are the third kind of thing and they are server-bound: on one server, the archive on its disks, and later a GPU. A resource has no controller; it has a lifecycle policy. The worker writes to it; nothing moves it.

| The controller                          | **`vmscontroller` is the only writer of configuration in the cluster** — cameras, their sources, their assignment to workers — by CAS into the platform's config store; the console's write API is its client                                                                                                                                                                                                | One writer per key, one level up: М11 Lesson 2's rule applied to the whole subsystem. Edits are consistent inside the cluster because the store is; the controller's outage stops edits and nothing else; it is **never on the recovery path** — a worker restarts from its assignment without asking anyone                                                                                                                                                               |
| Where configuration lives               | **The platform's config store** (`vms/cameras/<id>`, `vms/workers/<worker>`), written by the controller, read by workers; the platform's object store for what is large (segments, heartbeats, config snapshots). On one server: a **file-backed Variables with `ModifyIndex` and CAS**, and a directory. In М11: Nomad Variables and MinIO, with no change to the VMS                                         | The three-stores rule from М11 Lesson 2, applied before there is a cluster. A camera row is small, rare and must be consistent; a segment is large; a heartbeat is frequent and never queried by key. Postgres held all three in М9 because it was the only store; the platform has three, so the Node needs none                                                                                                                                                          |
| Who decides how many workers, and where | **The scheduler and its autoscaler — never the controller** *(12 September 2026)*. On one box the operator starts `vmsworker@w-N`; in М11 Nomad runs `count = N` and the Nomad Autoscaler moves `N` from a number the workers export — **headroom** (cameras a worker could still take, from М9 Lesson 7's `B + n·I` measured on its server), not CPU. The controller has no scheduler client and no `count` | Placement of *processes onto servers* is the platform's work (ARCHITECTURE §1.11); the controller places *cameras onto workers it sees*. A controller that could ask for a worker needs a model of the servers, a client for the scheduler and a policy about cost — three things that would make it stateful and product-specific. CPU is a symptom; headroom is the demand: two hundred idle cameras at night are still assigned                                         |
| Worker identity                         | **A slot, claimed by CAS** — `vms/slots/<name>` `{holder, until, released, gen}`, renewed with the lease pass, released on an orderly stop. A replacement process takes a *lapsed* slot before a new number and so inherits its assignment; with the scheduler's index (`NOMAD_ALLOC_INDEX`, `systemd`'s `%i`) it takes that slot outright and the old holder fences on renewal                              | `count = N` gives interchangeable processes; an assignment is written to a name. Without a claim, a replacement under a new name leaves its predecessor's cameras in a row nobody reads — and the only fix would be the controller noticing a silence, the healing it must never do. `released` is what tells scale-in from a crash: the controller redistributes a released slot's cameras (its one unasked move) and leaves a lapsed one for the scheduler to bring back |
| Whose number is capacity                | **The worker's.** `B + n·I` is measured on the server the pipelines run on; each worker carries `capacity` and `headroom` in its heartbeat; the controller's `capacity_of(w)` reads it, and its own constant is only the fallback for a heartbeat that says nothing *(12 September 2026)*                                                                                                                    | One number in one place, the same place the autoscaler reads it from. A controller that knew capacity would have to know the servers. Nothing tells a worker to start a camera: the controller writes the id into the assignment row and the worker reads its row every pass — a row and a poll, no RPC                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Events | **Buckets on the resource, a platform piece** (`vmsplatform/events.py`): `<resource>/<subsystem>/<unit>/e<epoch>/<start>Z.events.jsonl`, written by the worker holding that unit's epoch — **recording or not**; `silent` is itself an event — rolled by the clock, closed into the manifest, counted onto an overlapping media span, fenced by the path, rebuilt by repair, retained by `events_retention_days` apart from media. The VMS's buckets sit under `vms/<cam>/` beside its footage; any other subsystem's under its own prefix on the same resource. **No controller writes events; an index over them (М11's `eventindex`) is a cache** *(12 September 2026)* | An event is an observation: append-only, keyed by unit and time — the manifest's shape, not a table's. The archive's unit is a time span under an epoch, not a media file: a watched-but-not-recorded camera has buckets and no segments. A detector's event about camera 7 carries `cam: 7` as a field and lives in the detector's own bucket, because camera 7's bucket has exactly one writer. A single writer of all events would be a serialization point on the hot path and a process on the recovery path of something continuous |
| The resource, as a platform piece | **`vmsplatform/resource.py`**: a resource is a server's, not a subsystem's — it heartbeats its tree, serves every subsystem's buckets, retains them by `<sub>/retention[/<unit>]` rows the subsystem's controller writes, mirrors closed buckets to the next resource when `platform/mirror` is on, restores after a replaced disk, and runs the pass a subsystem registers. The VMS registers `ArchivePolicy` (manifests, media) *(12 September 2026)* | Media is the VMS's; the tree, the copies and the retention of buckets are not. `test_the_resource_is_a_platform_job_that_mirrors_any_subsystems_buckets` runs it with subsystems that do not exist |
| Sharding on one server                    | **None — and the worker is a shard from day one**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | One box, one `vmsworker`, every camera assigned to it.

## Where configuration lives, and who writes it

This was the open question, and the answer follows from two things the course already decided.

**М9 gave the Node its own Postgres so that an operator could edit a camera with everything above the Node unreachable.** That argument was about the *domain*: М12 may be down, and the Node must still accept an edit. It said nothing about a writer *inside the cluster*. Under 2c the worker is stateless and the platform's stores are the cluster's; a single writer of configuration inside the cluster — the controller — keeps every property М9 wanted (edits work with the domain gone; the store is one raft, so edits are consistent) and drops the one М9 paid for it (a database per process, migrated at boot on a box nobody visits).

**М11 said one writer per key, and М12 said correctness comes from how a write is made, never from how many instances there are.** The controller is that rule made into a process: it writes `vms/cameras/<id>` and `vms/workers/<worker>` by CAS, and if Nomad briefly runs two of it, the second gets a conflict and re-reads. It holds nothing in memory that is not in the store — the moment it does, the count starts to matter.

So the answer is: **the controller writes, the platform stores, the worker reads its share.**

```
console ──PUT /cameras/7──▶ vmscontroller ──CAS──▶ vms/cameras/7        {source, enabled, revision}
                                          ──CAS──▶ vms/workers/w-1      {cameras: "1,2,7", rev}
                                                                          │
vmsworker w-1 ◀── reads its assignment, then each camera row ◀────────────┘
              ──▶ vms/w-1/heartbeat (object)   {ts, epoch per camera, phase per camera}
```

Two lines to hold, both from М11. **The controller is never on the recovery path.** A worker that restarts — killed, rescheduled, moved — reads its assignment and its cameras and records; it does not ask the controller, and if the controller is down the restart is identical. **The controller does not heal.** It assigns new cameras and moves cameras when an operator asks; a dead worker is Nomad's to restart, with its assignment on its name. The failure arithmetic on one server:

| Down | What stops | What continues |
|---|---|---|
| `vmscontroller` | edits; adding a camera | recording; restarts of the worker; the console's read model (from heartbeats) |
| `vmsworker` | recording, until Nomad (or `systemd` on one box) restarts it — seconds | edits (they are applied when the worker returns and reads its assignment) |
| the archive resource (the disk) | promotion of closed segments; the spool fills at the rate М9 Lesson 4 measured | recording into the spool, until the spool's high-water policy |
| the config store | edits and new assignments | recording — the worker holds its assignment in memory and needs the store only to change |

---

## The worker is DriverPack

The second open question was whether workers should run *inside* DriverPack's process. Yes, and the stronger statement is the right one: **DriverPack is the worker.** There is no process called "the worker" that hosts DriverPack; `vmsworker` is what DriverPack is called when it is running as a shard of the VMS subsystem.

What that means concretely:

- **One supervisor.** The worker's reconcile loop — assignment versus running pipelines, `>=` on the revision, exponential backoff with jitter, `lost()` on a bus error — is the loop from М9 Lesson 6, running in the same process as the pipelines. Nomad supervises the process; the process supervises its pipelines; nothing supervises the loop, because the loop is the process.
- **Scaling is the scheduler's.** How many `vmsworker`s a cluster runs is the job's `count`; the controller assigns cameras to the workers it sees heartbeating. Whether the controller may *change* the count — asking Nomad for another worker when the assigned load per worker exceeds М9 Lesson 7's `B + n·I` budget — is an open question below; on one server the count is one.
- **Crash isolation is by shards and by external state.** A vendor SDK that segfaults takes the shard's loop with it, and that is acceptable only because the state is outside: the scheduler restarts the shard, it reloads its assignment, the epoch and the lease make the restart harmless. This module writes that sentence into a test: `kill -9` the worker mid-segment; the spool keeps the closed segments; the restart resumes into the next epoch; the manifest names both.
- **The per-frame rule holds by construction** in C++ and by discipline in Python: the prototype's worker touches no buffer, and the tee's branches are for consumers in other processes.

**The subsystem contract**, which is what the platform actually knows:

| The platform provides | The subsystem provides |
|---|---|
| a config prefix `<subsystem>/*` in the config store, writable by the controller only (one ACL policy) | a **controller** job: `count = 1`, writes by CAS, holds nothing |
| assignment rows `<subsystem>/workers/<worker>` | a **worker** job: `count = N`, reads its row, runs the work, heartbeats |
| an object prefix `<subsystem>/` for heartbeats and anything large | a heartbeat object per worker: `{ts, epoch, status: [...]}` |
| a metrics scrape per job (М13) | what its two numbers are — for the VMS, `camera_lag` and `camera_silent_seconds` from М9 Lesson 9 |
| the epoch issuer and the lease (М11 Lesson 4), generic | the key it puts the epoch in |

`platform/` in this module implements the left column on one box — `FileVariables` with `ModifyIndex` and CAS, `FsObjectStore`, an epoch issuer, a lease — behind the same interfaces `clustervms/` uses, so that М11 replaces the implementations and not the contract. `vms/` implements the right column. `tests/test_second_subsystem.py` implements a trivial third thing — a `countercontroller` and a `counterworker` that count seconds — through the same platform code, to prove the boundary is real.

---

## The three GStreamer artifacts

**`driverpacksrc`** — a `Gst.Bin` with one `src` pad. `uri=driverpack://file/lobby.mp4` resolves to `<media_dir>/lobby.mp4`; inside: `filesrc ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! identity sync=true`, looping on EOS by seeking to zero, and — the one part that is not mechanical — **rebasing timestamps** so that PTS is monotonic across the loop and the pipeline's running time never goes backwards. That is exactly the work a real DriverPack element does with a vendor SDK's clock, which is why it is built here and tested first. `uri=driverpack://<vendor>/<host>` is refused with the message that names the real thing.

**`archivesink`** — a `Gst.Bin` with one `sink` pad wrapping `splitmuxsink` with `max-size-time = SEGMENT_SECONDS`, `muxer-factory = mp4mux`, `async-finalize = true`. Its `format-location` names `<spool>/<cam>/e<epoch>/<start>Z.mp4`. On `fragment-closed` it **promotes** the segment — `rename` into the archive resource on one box, `PUT` in М11 — and appends a line to `<archive>/<cam>/manifest.jsonl`: `{epoch, start, end, path, bytes}`. The promotion is the acknowledgement; the spool copy is deleted after it, never before (М9 Lesson 4's rule). A segment younger than two segment lengths with no manifest line is *open*, not lost.

**The manifest** replaces М9 Lesson 5's `segments` table. It is append-only, per camera, rebuildable by walking the archive (М11's re-index sweep becomes *manifest repair*), and it is what the timeline query reads. Retention is a policy on the resource — delete lines and files older than N days per camera, in that order — not a table partition.

## Lessons

*Five lessons, written — [the index](README.md); the code is [`vmsserver/`](vmsserver/README.md). Each builds one artifact, and the last builds the second subsystem to prove the first one is not special.*

### Lesson 1 — The subsystem contract

- What the platform is, and the test that it knows nothing about video
- `platform/`: `FileVariables` with `ModifyIndex` and CAS (the same semantics `FakeVariables` promised in М11 Lesson 2, on disk), `FsObjectStore`, the epoch issuer, the lease
- The contract table, and the ACL it implies: `vms/*` writable by one identity; a worker writes its epochs and its slot
- **Identity by claim**: a name is a slot taken by CAS; a replacement inherits a lapsed slot; `released` tells scale-in from a crash; who decides `N` (not the controller)
- Where configuration lives — the argument above, made against М9 Lessons 5 and 9
- What a server is now

**Deliverable:** the platform package with its tests; a config store on disk that survives a restart and refuses a stale CAS; and the contract written as a document a second team could implement from.

### Lesson 2 — `driverpacksrc`

- A GStreamer element in Python: `Gst.Bin`, pads, properties, registration as a plugin
- Files as cameras: the media directory, the URI scheme, the loop
- **Timestamps** — rebasing across the loop; what `identity sync=true` does and does not do; the pipeline clock
- The refusal: `driverpack://hikvision/…` names the element the product ships and this one does not
- The per-frame rule, restated for an element author

**Deliverable:** `gst-launch-1.0 driverpacksrc uri=driverpack://file/lobby.mp4 ! h264parse ! fakesink -v` running for an hour with monotonic PTS, and the element's unit tests.

### Lesson 3 — `archivesink`, and the archive as a resource

- `splitmuxsink` inside a bin; `format-location` with the epoch; `fragment-closed`
- Spool → promote → manifest: the acknowledgement order, and `kill -9` mid-segment
- The manifest as the index: append, read, rebuild
- Retention as a policy on the resource; the high-water rule when the resource is slower than the source
- What a resource is: server-bound, no controller, a policy

**Deliverable:** record a file-camera for ten minutes; kill the worker at minute seven; show one open segment lost, six promoted, the manifest complete; rebuild the manifest from the archive alone and diff it.

### Lesson 4 — `vmsworker`: DriverPack as the worker

- The reconcile loop over an *assignment* rather than a table: `vms/workers/<worker>` and `vms/cameras/<id>`
- N pipelines in one process; the state machine, backoff and jitter, `lost()` — ported from М9 Lessons 6 and 8 with their tests
- The heartbeat object with the status snapshot (the same one М12's console reads)
- The epoch per camera by CAS, and the lease gate on every start; two workers given one camera on purpose
- **Kill it.** The worker restarts with the controller stopped; nothing asks the controller

**Deliverable:** М9 Lesson 8's four failures reproduced against the worker — pipeline death, stall, store unreachable, `kill -9` — with the contract's tests passing unchanged in meaning; and the zombie experiment on one server.

### Lesson 5 — `vmscontroller`, and the second subsystem

- The only writer: camera CRUD by CAS; assignment; what it refuses (М12 Lesson 3's list, at the cluster)
- Two controllers at once, and why nothing breaks
- The console: the read model from heartbeats (М12 Lesson 3, on one box), the write API as the controller's client
- The failure arithmetic, measured: stop each process in turn and say what stopped
- **The second subsystem**: `countercontroller` and `counterworker` through the same platform code — the proof that the VMS is a subsystem and not the platform

**Deliverable:** one box, two subsystems, one console; `INSERT`-equivalent (`PUT /cameras`) starts a recording; the controller stopped, the worker killed, recording resumes; and a written statement of what the platform knows about the VMS (nothing).

## Verification plan

**Track 1 — in the authoring sandbox, milliseconds:** the platform stores (CAS, persistence, the epoch issuer, the lease, slots claimed, lapsed, inherited and released); the worker's loop and state machine with a fake actuator (М9's tests, ported); the controller's CRUD and assignment with two racing writers; the manifest's append, read and rebuild against a fake filesystem; the read model; the second subsystem end to end.

**Track 2 — needs a box with GStreamer (`python3-gi`, `gst-plugins-good/bad`):** the two elements, the promotion of real segments, `kill -9` mid-segment, the hour-long PTS run, and the zombie experiment with two real worker processes. The same bench as М9's.

Every number printed in a lesson comes from Track 1 unless the lesson says which Track 2 run it came from.

## Open questions

1. ~~Who changes the worker count.~~ — **Decided (12 September 2026): the scheduler and its autoscaler, from headroom the workers export; the controller never.** The decision row *Who decides how many workers* and *Worker identity* above; the mechanism is identity by claim in `vmsplatform/contract.py` (Lesson 1, Step 5a), the redistribution of a released slot in `vms/controller.py` (Lesson 5, Step 4a), and the `scaling` policy on the worker job in [М11](../М11_ClusterVMS/module-design.md).
2. **Where the live branch is consumed on one box.** М12's gateway subscribes to the tee; on a single server with no gateway job, is a local viewer a worker concern or a gateway concern? The module leaves the branch unsubscribed.
3. **The manifest under concurrent promotion.** Two workers on one camera (a reassignment window) both append to one manifest; lines carry the epoch so playback is unambiguous, but the file needs an append lock or per-epoch manifests. Decide by measurement in Lesson 3.
4. **The worker's language in the product.** М9 Lesson 9's argument (Go for the controller, C++ for the media worker) stands; whether `vmscontroller` is Go and `vmsworker` is DriverPack's C++ from the first release, or the Python prototype ships for small sites, is not this module's to decide.

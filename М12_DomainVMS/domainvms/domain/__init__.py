"""DomainVMS — М12. The smallest layer that can sit above a set of clusters,
be switched off, and be the top of the product.

Built on М11's clustervms (imported, not copied) and through it on М9's
nodevms. Exactly three things a cluster cannot know — lookup across
clusters, which cluster gets a camera, whether an answer is complete — plus
the discipline of a layer that may be down: a signer that is the top of
its own trust, identity that never reaches a Node, grants that expire, a
box that joins with nobody typing a secret, and a read model that says how
old it is.

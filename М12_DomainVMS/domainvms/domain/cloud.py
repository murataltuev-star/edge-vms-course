"""Lesson 8 — a cluster you rent, and a Node that does not know where it is.

The bandwidth arithmetic, done before the demo: fifty cameras at 4 Mbit/s
is 200 Mbit/s sustained upstream and ~2 TB a day. Most sites cannot buy
that, so recording stays at the edge and operation moves to the cloud —
MIXED is the shape a real deployment takes. And a Node deployed three ways
— local server, rented instance, split — is the SAME artifact; if it is
not, this lesson found a bug in М9 or М11.

"""Lesson 1 — placement at the level above the one М11 built.

    Nomad     picks the SERVER   on resources        because it knows the servers
    Cluster   picks the NODE     on capacity         because only it measures its Nodes (М11 Lesson 5)
    Domain    picks the CLUSTER  on REACHABILITY     because only it knows which clusters exist and what each can see

Reachability, not capacity: a camera on the warehouse VLAN can be reached
from the warehouse cluster and from nowhere else. Capacity only breaks ties
among clusters that can see the camera at all.

Only place when you must: the camera is new, or an operator asked. A dead
server is not a trigger (the Node moves). A dead cluster is not a trigger
either — its cameras cannot be reached from anywhere else.

The placement is STORED, with a reason and a time, in the domain cluster's
Variables under domain/placement/<camera> — by check-and-set, which is why
two placers racing is harmless: the second gets a conflict and re-reads.

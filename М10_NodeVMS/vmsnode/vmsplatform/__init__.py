"""The platform, on one box (the package is `vmsplatform` only because Python owns the name `platform`). Everything here would host any fleet of
stateless shards writing bulk data; nothing here knows what a camera is.

    variables.py   a small, consistent config store with ModifyIndex and check-and-set (file-backed)
    objects.py     an object store (a directory)
    epoch.py       the fencing-token issuer and the lease, generic
    contract.py    what a subsystem gives the platform: a controller and its workers

М11 replaces variables.py with Nomad Variables and objects.py with MinIO,
behind the same interfaces, and changes nothing above this line.

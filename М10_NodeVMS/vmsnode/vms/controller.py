"""vmscontroller — the only writer of vms/*.

    cameras       CRUD by CAS; revision bumps on every operator edit; refuses controller-owned fields
    placement     which worker runs a camera — by capacity, stored with a reason, never derived;
                  adding a worker moves nothing; rebalance only when asked, budgeted
    assignment    vms/workers/<worker> — what each worker reads

It holds nothing. Two instances are harmless: every write is
read-modify-write by CAS, and the loser re-reads. It is never on the
recovery path: a worker restarts from its assignment without asking.

# Module 10 — NodeVMS: The Platform's Shape on One Node

[Module 9](../М9_EdgeVMS/README.md) ends with a box that owns its OS and its truth: an A/B root under RAUC, and a Node whose Postgres holds what it should be while an AppHost makes it so. This module takes that Node apart and rebuilds it on the shape the course arrived at last — **a controller, workers, and resources** — on one box, so that every piece can be seen running before [М11](../М11_ClusterVMS/README.md) spreads it across servers.

Five lessons, each building one artifact: a GStreamer source that plays files as if they were cameras; an archive that is a resource, on the spool's discipline, with a manifest instead of an index; the worker — DriverPack itself — running М9's loop over an assignment; the controller that is the only writer of configuration; and a second, trivial subsystem that proves the platform knows nothing about video. No scheduler, no KVS, no database.

The design brief is [`module-design.md`](module-design.md); the first NodeVMS design it supersedes is [`node-design.md`](../М9_EdgeVMS/node-design.md), whose tests this module keeps.

## The thesis

| | Controller | Worker | Resource |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | the only writer of `vms/*` — cameras, assignment, placement | DriverPack with N cameras assigned; the pipelines and their routing | the archive on this box's disks; later a GPU |
| How many | one — and safe at two | `N`, decided by the scheduler and its autoscaler from the workers' headroom — never by the controller | one per server |
| State | none: computation over the stores | none but a spool | the footage and its manifest |
| When it is down | edits stop; nothing running stops | its cameras pause until it is restarted; the edit made meanwhile is waiting | promotion pauses; recording continues into the spool |

> **The controller writes, the platform stores, the worker reads its share.** The platform — a config store with check-and-set, an object store, an epoch issuer, a lease, and slots that give `count = N` processes stable names by claim — knows the shape of a subsystem and nothing about a camera. `vmsplatform/` has no import from `vms/`, and a test greps it for the word.

**What changed since М9's Node**, and what did not. KVS is gone — the archive is ours. The per-Node Postgres is gone — configuration lives in the platform's store and has one writer. The AppHost is gone — the thing that holds the pipeline supervises itself. What is kept, and enforced by the same tests: desired persisted and actual derived, `>=` on the revision, backoff with jitter, positions apart from reasons, the epoch in the path, commit-then-publish, the heartbeat carrying its status.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | You'll be able to... |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [The Subsystem Contract](01-the-subsystem-contract.md) | Say what the platform is and is not; build a config store with `ModifyIndex` and CAS and prove two writers cannot both win; build the epoch issuer and the lease as platform pieces; write the contract as a table; enforce one writer per prefix; give `N` processes stable names by claim and say who decides `N`; say what a Node is now. |
| 2 | [`driverpacksrc`](02-driverpacksrc.md) | Write a GStreamer element in Python; resolve `driverpack://file/<name>` and refuse the vendor form by name; loop a file with PTS rebased so time never goes backwards; restate the per-frame rule for an element author. |
| 3 | [`archivesink`, and the Archive as a Resource](03-archivesink-and-the-archive-as-a-resource.md) | State the promotion order and what each step protects; account for a kill at minute seven; replace the index table with a manifest and rebuild it from files; mark a fenced epoch and merge two resources; apply retention as a policy in the order that survives a crash. |
| 4 | [`vmsworker`: DriverPack as the Worker](04-vmsworker-driverpack-as-the-worker.md) | Claim a slot and inherit a lapsed one; run М9's loop over an assignment with М9's tests unchanged; take an epoch per camera by CAS and gate starts on a lease; publish the heartbeat with headroom; prove the controller is never on the recovery path; tell a zombie from a reassignment. |
| 5 | [`vmscontroller`, and the Second Subsystem](05-vmscontroller-and-the-second-subsystem.md) | CRUD by CAS with the revision bump in the controller; refuse what a client may not set; place by capacity, stored with a reason, adding a worker moves nothing; two controllers agree; redistribute a released slot and leave a lapsed one alone; measure the failure arithmetic; run a second subsystem through the same platform. |

## The demo the module is built backwards from

One box. `POST /cameras {"source": "driverpack://file/lobby.mp4"}` and within one worker pass a pipeline is recording into `<spool>/1/e1/`; ten minutes later the first segment is in the archive with a line in its manifest. Then:

```bash
systemctl stop vmscontroller          # nothing running stops; the console still lists the camera from the heartbeat
systemctl kill -s KILL vmsworker@w-1   # the open segment is lost; the closed one in the spool is promoted on restart
                                      # and the edit you made while it was dead is applied — from the store, not from anyone
```

Then the zombie on one box: `kill -STOP` the worker, start a second `vmsworker@w-1`, `kill -CONT` the first — it renews its lease, finds the newer epoch, fences itself and stops; the manifest names both epochs and marks the old one *fenced*. And finally a second subsystem — a controller and a worker that count seconds — through the same platform code, with a different prefix, proving the VMS is a subsystem and not the platform.

## What you can verify without hardware

Nearly all of it. [`vmsnode/`](vmsnode/README.md) is the five lessons as one runnable package, and its 38 tests need no GStreamer: the config store's persistence and CAS with four threads racing; the epoch issuer and the lease on a fake clock; the ACL; slots claimed, lapsed, inherited and released; the promotion order on real files, the kill-at-minute-seven accounting, the manifest rebuilt from the archive alone, the fenced epoch on a timeline, retention; М9 Lesson 6's seven tests against the worker's loop, the epoch per camera, the restart with the controller object deleted, the zombie and the reassignment that is not one; the controller's refusals, stored placement, two controllers racing to place forty cameras, scale-in redistributed and a crash left alone, the failure arithmetic with the clock, the console over real HTTP; and the counter subsystem. Every number in the lessons came out of those tests.

**Needs a box with GStreamer** — `python3-gi`, `gst-plugins-good` and `-bad`, М9's bench: the two elements and the actuator (`gstvms/`), the hour-long PTS run, `kill -9` mid-segment on real files, and the zombie with two real worker processes. `deploy/` has the `systemd` units: `vmscontroller.service`, `vmsworker@.service`, and the archive resource's policy on a timer.

# EdgeVMS — the М9 artifacts, whole

Lessons 16–19 assembled: the bench, the PKI, the RAUC configuration and
bundle builder, the GRUB state machine, the health check, the Quadlet units,
and the spool. None of this is code the Node runs; it is the box the Node
runs on.

```
edgevms/
  bench/
    build-disk.sh          L16 — ESP | rootfs0 | rootfs1 | data; debootstrap slot A; copy to B; GRUB by hand
    boot.sh                L16 — QEMU/OVMF with KVM auto-detect, a monitor socket, port forwards
    outage.sh              L19 — pull the cable for N seconds; L18 — the pulled plug (power-cut)
  pki/
    make-ca.sh             L17 — two-level CA; keyring = the root only; and the attacker's CA
    verify-chain.sh        L17 — the three proofs with `openssl cms`: accepted, wrong signer, tampered
  rauc/
    system.conf            L17 — compatible, data-directory, bundle-formats=-plain
    manifest.raucm         L17 — verity, no sha256/size
    build-bundle.sh        L17/L18 — good, --broken-kernel, --broken-config, --rogue, --wrong-hardware
  boot/
    grub.cfg               L18 — ORDER / OK / TRY; one attempt per slot; env on the ESP
    seed-grubenv.sh        L18 — grub-editenv create + set
  health/
    rauc-health-check      L18 — the ladder, with row 3 now REAL: the Node's own signal
    rauc-mark-good.service L18 — ExecStartPost only on success; the rollback needs no code
  quadlet/
    storage.conf           L19 — graphroot on /data, in the image
    vms-agent.container    L19 — the М8 agent under systemd
    spool-uploader.container   L19 — the uploader as its own process
    agent.env.example      L19 — the first temporary secret, named
    check-quadlet.sh       L19 — generator --dryrun, not systemd-analyze
  spool/
    spool.py               L19 — Spool, drain, the two signals, and the uploader main loop
    test_spool.py          L19 — the five tests, plus one for the signals
```

## The seam this closes

Lesson 18's health check has to reach *is footage actually being written*,
and Lesson 18 was written before the Node existed, so its third row was a
stand-in: "a segment appeared in the spool in the last N seconds". That
check is weak on purpose (a fast uploader empties the spool) and the lesson
marks it.

`health/rauc-health-check` now prefers the real thing. М10's Node exports
`nodevms_camera_silent_seconds_max` on `127.0.0.1:8080/metrics` — the same
number М13 alarms on — and the health check reads it **locally**, with the
uplink down, and decides:

| Node says | Verdict |
|---|---|
| AppHost not reporting | fail — the console is up and nobody is home |
| cameras configured, none has ever written a segment | fail — boots perfectly, records nothing (Lesson 18, failure two) |
| newest segment older than `2 × SEGMENT_SECONDS + 60` | fail |
| no cameras configured | pass, and says so — a stated product decision, not a hidden one |
| otherwise | pass |

Without a Node (an М9-only bench) it falls back to the agent's `/health`
plus the spool stand-in, exactly as Lesson 18 wrote it. It touches nothing
outside the box either way.

The window is `2 × SEGMENT_SECONDS + 60` because a healthy Node is silent
for up to one segment length between closes; a 120-second window against
ten-minute segments would roll back every good update. `rauc-mark-good.service`'s
`ExecStartPre` sleep must clear a segment length for the same reason.

## Running it

Host: Linux with `qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils ovmf parted e2fsprogs dosfstools debootstrap socat rauc openssl`.

```bash
pki/make-ca.sh && pki/verify-chain.sh          # Step 3 of Lesson 17, two minutes, no VM
bench/build-disk.sh                             # builds ~/edge-bench/appliance.qcow2 (asks for a root password)
bench/boot.sh                                   # Ctrl-a x quits. ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1 works.

# Lesson 17
rauc/build-bundle.sh 2026.09-1
scp -P 2222 ~/edge-bundle/update-2026.09-1.raucb root@127.0.0.1:/data/
#   in the VM:   rauc install /data/update-2026.09-1.raucb && rauc status && grub-editenv /boot/efi/grubenv list
rauc/build-bundle.sh 2026.09-1-rogue --rogue     # refused before writing anything
rauc/build-bundle.sh 2026.09-1-armhf --wrong-hardware

# Lesson 18: three failures
rauc/build-bundle.sh 2026.09-2-broken --broken-kernel     # GRUB tries B, kernel dies, next boot is A
rauc/build-bundle.sh 2026.09-3-broken --broken-config     # boots perfectly, records nothing, health check fails, next boot is A
bench/outage.sh power-cut                                 # mid rauc install: A untouched, B worthless, reinstall

# Lesson 19
bench/outage.sh 600                                       # ten minutes without an uplink; then find the footage
python3 spool/test_spool.py
```

The bench image includes `rauc`, `podman`, `grub-common`, `curl` and
`python3` (build-disk.sh's `--include`), and installs `system.conf`,
`storage.conf`, the Quadlet units, the health check and `spool.py` into
slot A **before** it is copied to B — Lesson 19's rule that the moment you
type it by hand on a running box is the moment it is missing from the other
slot.

## What was verified where

- **Run, output real:** `pki/make-ca.sh` and `pki/verify-chain.sh` against OpenSSL 3.0.13 (the three refusals come out exactly as Lesson 17 prints them; note `openssl cms -verify` exits 4 on a refusal, which is why the script judges by message). `spool/test_spool.py`, six tests. `health/rauc-health-check` against a fake Node serving seven `/metrics` scenarios — healthy, silent 45 min, never recorded, AppHost not reporting, no cameras, no Node and no agent, agent-plus-spool — each giving the verdict in the table above.
- **Written to the documentation, not executed here:** `bench/build-disk.sh` (needs KVM/nbd/debootstrap and root), `rauc/build-bundle.sh` (needs `rauc`), `boot/grub.cfg` (RAUC's reference logic, copied from Lesson 18), the Quadlet units (need Podman's generator — `quadlet/check-quadlet.sh` is the check). They pass `bash -n`; the first run belongs on your bench.

## Known gaps, named

- `--broken-config` breaks the Quadlet `Image=` inside the image, not `agent.env` as Lesson 18 describes, because `agent.env` lives on `/data` and is not in any bundle. Same failure — boots perfectly, records nothing — reached the only way a bundle can reach it.
- `vms-agent.container` and `spool-uploader.container` run `localhost/example/vms-agent:1.0`, built by `make agent-image` in [`М8_KVS_VMS/kvsvms/`](../../М8_KVS_VMS/kvsvms/README.md) from the course root. That image carries `/health`, this directory's `spool.py` at `/app/spool.py`, and `vms-upload-segment` — the acknowledged uploader (`kvsvms/edge/upload_segment.py`): a `kvssink` re-publish in offline mode with the segment's original start time, followed by `ListFragments` over the segment's span. Exit 0 only when the archive has it.
- `outage.sh` needs `socat` for the monitor socket; `Ctrl-a c` and `set_link nic0 off` by hand is the fallback.
